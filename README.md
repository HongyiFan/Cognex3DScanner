# Cognex3DScanner
Cognex 3D Scanner for LEMS Lab

This repository contains all the code for a complete cognex in-sight camera based linear 3D scanner. 

More documents need to be added. For example, the hardware documentation. 

File list:
1. Cognex-Linear-Scanner-50x70: Arduino code
2. Hongyi_Scanner.job: .job file for In-sight Explorer. 
3. calibrate_laser.m; calibrate_stage.m, readPoints.m, reconstruct_scan.m: Matlab code for all the calibrations
4. live_view.m: Matlab code for live view of the scanner.
